## Design Choices

The resume website was made to display education, work experience, and projects, with a fun side. With emphasis on highlighting my education, experience, and previous projects. The following design choices were made bearing this in mind:

### Fonts
- The primary font 'exo' was chosen to be the main text of this site as it is simple, and looks professional. 

- The secondary font 'Roboto' was chosen for the main headings as it is very popular, looks professional, and styles well in both lower and uppercase.

### Icons
- Very few icons were used, as to avoid overcrowding. 
- The **envelope** icon was placed next to the site owners email address to make it stand out, and to make it's purpose clear when doing a quick glance.
- The **phone** icon was placed next to the site owners phone number to make it standout, and to make it's purpose clear when doing a quick glance. 
- The **Facebook logo** icon, **Instagram logo** icon, **LinkedIn logo** icon, and **GitHub logo** icon are included in the footer to lead visitors to the site owners social media accounts.

### Colours
- bright pink: #FF1493
- purple: #FF00FF
- green: #32CD32
- bright green:#00FF00
- blue: #00BFFF
- bright blue: #40CCFF
- white: #f4f4f4

- The bright contrasting colors were chosen for this website because they standout on the dark background, which helps highlight important information. The bright colors also add an element of fun to the website.
